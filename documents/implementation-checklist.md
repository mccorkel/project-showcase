## Next Steps

Now that we have set up the authentication, data storage, and created placeholder pages for all of the routes, our next steps are:

1. **Implement Core Features**:
   - Connect placeholder pages to the Amplify backend
   - Implement data fetching and mutation logic
   - Add styling to match the design system

2. **Implement Template System**:
   - Connect template creation interface to backend
   - Implement template preview functionality
   - Set up template storage and loading

These steps will allow us to build out the core functionality of the application.

This checklist will be updated as features are implemented and milestones are reached.
