   - Create placeholder components for all remaining pages

2. **Implement Core Features**:
   - Start with user profile management
   - Implement submission management
   - Create showcase management functionality

3. **Implement Template System**:
   - Create template creation interface
   - Implement template preview functionality
   - Set up template storage and loading

These steps will allow us to build out the core functionality of the application.

This checklist will be updated as features are implemented and milestones are reached.
