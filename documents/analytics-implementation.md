## Implementation Details

### Data Storage

Analytics data is stored in the Analytics table in DynamoDB with the following structure:

- Showcase views are aggregated daily
- Project views are tracked individually
- Referrer data is categorized and counted
- Geographic data includes country, region, and city
- Device data is categorized by type

### Data Visualization

The application uses the following technologies for data visualization:

- **Recharts**: React charting library for creating interactive charts
- **AWS Amplify UI**: UI components for displaying data
- **Custom Components**: Purpose-built components for specific analytics views

### Privacy Considerations

The analytics system is designed with privacy in mind:

- Students can only see analytics for their own showcases
- Instructors can only see analytics for students in their cohorts
- Administrators can see system-wide analytics
- Personal identifying information is not included in analytics data
- IP addresses are anonymized in the stored data

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the analytics system include:

- **Real-time Analytics**: Live updates of showcase views
- **Advanced Filtering**: More granular filtering options
- **Custom Reports**: Ability to create and save custom reports
- **Predictive Analytics**: Identify trends and make predictions
- **Integration with External Tools**: Export to Google Analytics or similar platforms

## Conclusion

The analytics implementation provides valuable insights at all levels of the application, helping students understand their showcase performance, instructors monitor their cohorts, and administrators oversee the entire system. The data-driven approach enables continuous improvement of the platform and enhances the educational experience for all users.
